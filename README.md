This project is a mini ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Scorer that evaluates the similarity between a resume and a job description. It uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity to generate a match percentage, and applies spaCy NLP to extract important keywords from the job description. The system identifies which keywords are present or missing in the candidate’s resume, providing actionable insights for resume optimization. A simple Flask web interface allows uploading .txt files to instantly compute results. Useful for students, job seekers, and beginners learning NLP-based text matching.
